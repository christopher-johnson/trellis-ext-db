# Trellis Linked Data Server (relational database)

Trellis is a scalable platform for building [linked data](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/) applications.
The `trellis-ext-db` project implements an alternate
persistence layer based on a relational database.

Postgresql and MySQL/MariaDB database connections are supported.

Java 8+ is required to run Trellis. To build this project, use this command:

```
$ ./gradlew install
```
